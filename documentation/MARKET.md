## 1. Construction & Infrastructure

**Volume**: CHF 17–20 billion (~45% of market)

### Characteristics
- Largest vertical, driven by infrastructure renewal (CHF 200B planned through 2030)
- Dominated by SBB (CHF 6B+ annual procurement), ASTRA (CHF 2.5B in 2022), cantonal building offices
- Highly standardized: NPK catalog (~1 million positions, 200+ chapters), mandatory IfA18 standard, CRBx exchange format
- Long procurement cycles, large contract values
- BIM adoption at only 18% – significant digitalization runway
- ASTRA awards 81% of contracts via direct award (freihändig)

### Major Procurers
| Entity | Annual Volume | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| SBB | CHF 6B+ | 360 procurement staff, SAP Ariba |
| ASTRA | CHF 1.9–2.5B | 3,082 contracts (2022) |
| City of Zurich Hochbauamt | ~270 procedures/year | BKP cost classification |

### Existing Solutions
| Platform | Focus | Model | Key Differentiator |
|----------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| **Olmero** | Construction | Freemium | Market leader, 20+ yrs, CHF 5B volume, 2,500+ architects, acquired by Byggfakta (2020, ~€15M) |
| **Devisio** | Construction | Free for bidders | Challenger since 2021, 1,800 tenders, 610 projects, NPK "Offer-Edi" editor |

### Ecosystem Requirements
- CRB certification for NPK integration (40+ certified software solutions)
- SIA 451/CRBx price editors
- Building permit database access
- 7,000+ NPK customers create network effects

### Opportunity
Low-Medium – well-served by Olmero but Devisio's rapid growth (Implenia, Marti, HRS as clients) shows market receptivity to challengers. BIM-to-procurement workflow integration represents untapped opportunity.

---

## 2. IT Services & Software

**Volume**: CHF 10–12 billion (~25% of market)
**Federal ICT**: CHF 1.3–2.4B annually

- Top suppliers: Swisscom (CHF 129M), SAP (CHF 45M), Atos (CHF 44M)
- Complex requirements, shorter cycles than construction
- Canton Bern ZBS ICT: framework agreements with 3-8 partners per lot

### Existing Solutions

## SME Pain Points (Validated by Swico 2024 Survey)

1. **Administrative burden** – Effort disproportionate to contract value (90%+ cite as "killer criterion")
2. **Reference requirements** – Catch-22 for newcomers
3. **Price weighting** – Often 80% price / 20% quality despite law revision intent
4. **"Consulting for free"** – Unpaid proposal effort
5. **Language barriers** – DE/FR/IT fragmentation, no AI translation
6. **Discovery fatigue** – Must monitor multiple language searches separately
7. **Direct awards** – 50% of IT contracts, 81% of ASTRA contracts never published
8. **No improvement perceived** – 80%+ see no change since 2021 reform

---

## Regulatory Environment

### 2021 Reform (BöB/IVöB Revision)
- Mandatory sustainability weighting (10% minimum)
- Lot division encouraged for SME access
- Electronic procurement mandated
- Quality criteria emphasis (vs pure price)

### Current Reality
- Sustainability criteria adoption: ~7.2% (below mandate)
- Price weighting still dominates in practice
- SIMAP 2024 platform refresh added e-submission
- 26 cantonal variations in implementation

### Key Thresholds (WTO/GPA)
- Supplies/services: CHF 230,000+
- Construction: CHF 8.7M+
- Above threshold = mandatory SIMAP publication

---

## Market Entry Recommendation

### Target Verticals (Priority Order)

1. **Healthcare** – Fragmented, hystrix proves model, Sana consolidation trend
2. **Environment** – Regulatory tailwind (10% mandate vs 7.2% actual), no incumbent
3. **Professional Services** – SME-heavy, consortium potential, no Swiss platform
4. **IT Services** – Growing volume, 90%+ dissatisfied SMEs, it-beschaffung.ch only aggregates

### Secondary Opportunities

5. **Construction** – Devisio proves challenger viability, BIM integration gap
6. **Transportation** – Fragmented operators, no aggregation platform

### Avoid Initially

- **Enterprise procurement** – SAP Ariba/JAGGAER entrenched
- **Pure aggregation** – Commoditized, low margins

### Positioning

> "Intelligent tender matching for Swiss SMEs – cross-sector, cross-lingual, mobile-first"

### Differentiation

- SME-appropriate filters (contract size, reference requirements, price weighting %)
- All three Swiss languages with AI translation (DE/FR/IT)
- Freemium model undercutting CHF 200–800/yr incumbents
- Mobile-first design (vs SIMAP "Windows 98" app)
- Consortium matching with template contracts
- ERP integration (Bexio, Abacus)
- Win probability scoring based on historical patterns

### Strategic Entry Vectors

1. **SME-first mobile platform** – Address 90%+ dissatisfaction
2. **Multilingual AI matching** – Cross-language tender discovery
3. **Consortium formation SaaS** – Template contracts, capability matching
4. **BIM-to-procurement workflow** – Bridge 18% digitalization gap
5. **Vertical-specific solutions** – Healthcare or IT services
