| No cross-sector SME platform | High | Nobody |
| No SME-appropriate filtering | High | Nobody |

## SME Pain Points

1. **Administrative burden** – Effort disproportionate to contract value
2. **Reference requirements** – Catch-22 for newcomers
3. **Language barriers** – DE/FR/IT fragmentation
4. **Discovery fatigue** – 58.7% find search effort too high
5. **Direct awards** – 50% of IT contracts never published

---

## Market Entry Recommendation

### Target Verticals (Priority Order)

1. **Healthcare** – Fragmented, no specialist, high volume
2. **Environment** – Regulatory tailwind, no incumbent
3. **Professional Services** – SME-heavy, consortium potential
4. **IT Services** – Growing, but high direct-award rate

### Avoid Initially

- **Construction** – Saturated by Olmero/Devisio

### Positioning

> "Intelligent tender matching for Swiss SMEs – cross-sector, cross-lingual, mobile-first"

### Differentiation

- SME-appropriate filters (contract size, reference requirements)
- All three Swiss languages (DE/FR/IT)
- Freemium model undercutting CHF 200–800/yr incumbents
- Mobile-first design for business owners on the go
- Consortium matching for complementary SMEs
