> Democratizing access to public procurement for small businesses across Europe.

---

## The Problem

Public tenders represent €2+ trillion annually in the EU alone. Yet small businesses rarely participate:

- **Discovery is fragmented** – SIMAP, TED, national portals, each with different interfaces
- **Monitoring is manual** – No alerts, no matching, just endless scrolling
- **Complexity favors incumbents** – Large firms have dedicated bid teams; SMEs don't

The result: public money flows to the same large contractors, while capable small businesses never see the opportunities.

---

## Our Solution

A single platform that:

1. **Aggregates** tenders from SIMAP, TED, and EU national portals
2. **Matches** opportunities to company profiles using CPV codes, regions, and capacity
3. **Alerts** businesses to relevant tenders before deadlines pass

Simple as: create a profile → get matched tenders → win contracts.

## Who We Serve

**Primary**: SMEs (1–50 employees) in construction, IT services, consulting, and specialized trades across Switzerland and the EU.

**Why them**: Big enough to deliver, too small to monitor procurement portals daily.

## Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Open** | Built on public data, open-source core |
| **Simple** | No training needed, no procurement jargon |
| **Fair** | Transparent matching, no pay-to-rank |
| **Mobile** | Works where business owners are – on site, in transit |

---

## Roadmap

| Phase | Scope | Timeline |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **1. SIMAP** | Switzerland only, core matching | Q1 |
| **2. TED** | EU-wide coverage | Q2 |
| **3. Intelligence** | Win probability, competitor insights | Q3+ |

---

## Success Metrics

- **SME participation rate** in matched tenders
- **Time saved** vs. manual monitoring (target: 10+ hrs/week)
- **First-time bidders** – companies who never bid before

---

## Non-Goals

- Bid writing or submission tools (for now)
- Enterprise procurement suites
- Paid placement or advertising

---

*We believe public contracts should be won on merit, not on who has time to check portals.*
